🎯 What I Learned

While building this project, I focused on:

Structuring clean and readable HTML

Proper spacing and alignment

Using Flexbox for layout control

Applying hover states for interactivity

Improving visual consistency (shadows, border-radius, typography)

This challenge helped me improve my attention to small UI details — especially padding, font weights, and card alignment.

🚀 Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:

Improve accessibility practices

Refine responsive techniques

Write more maintainable CSS

Move more of these small components into reusable systems (maybe React components next 👀)
